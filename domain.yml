  - text: "Top management, or its representative, when communicating to those in the organization, can support the importance of energy management through employee involvement activities such as empowerment, motivation, recognition, training and rewards and participation. Organizations conducting long-term planning can include energy management considerations such as energy source, energy performance, and energy performance improvements in the planning activities. The management representative may be a current, new or contracted organization employee, and their responsibilities may represent all or part of the job function. The energy management team ensures delivery of energy performance improvements, and its size is determined by the organization's complexity."

  utter_energy_policy_guidance:
  - text: "The energy policy is the driver for implementing and improving an organization's EnMS and energy performance within its scope and boundaries. The policy may be a brief statement that members of the organization can readily understand and apply to their work activities. The energy policy dissemination can be used as a driver to manage organizational behaviour. Where transportation is procured or used by the organization, the energy use and consumption of transport can be included in the scope and boundaries of the EnMS."

  utter_energy_planning_guidance:
  - text: "Figure A.2 in the standard provides a conceptual diagram intended to improve understanding of the energy planning process. This clause focuses on the energy performance of the organization and tools to maintain and continually improve energy performance. The energy planning process includes analyzing energy use and consumption, identifying areas of significant energy use, and identifying opportunities for improving energy performance, which lead to outputs such as energy baseline, EnPIs, objectives, targets, and action plans."

  utter_energy_review_guidance:
  - text: "The process of identification and evaluation of energy use should lead the organization to define areas of significant energy use and identify opportunities for improving energy performance. Examples of personnel working on behalf of the organization include service contractors, part-time personnel and temporary staff. Potential sources of energy can include conventional sources that have not been previously used by an organization. Alternative energy sources can include fossil or non-fossil fuels. Updating the energy review means updating the information related to the analysis, determination of significance and determination of improving energy performance opportunities."

  utter_energy_baseline_guidance:
  - text: "A suitable data period for an energy baseline means the organization accounts for regulatory requirements or variables that affect the energy use and consumption. Variables can include weather, seasons, business activity cycles and other conditions. The energy baseline is maintained and recorded as a means for the organization to determine the records maintenance period. The adjustments to the baseline are also considered maintenance and the requirements are defined in the International Standard."

  utter_enpi_guidance:
  - text: "Energy Performance Indicators (EnPIs) can be a simple parameter, a simple ratio or a complex model. Examples of EnPIs can include energy consumption per time, energy consumption per unit of production, and multi-variable models. The organization can choose EnPIs that inform the energy performance of their operation and can update the EnPIs when business activities or baselines change that affect the relevance of the EnPI, as applicable."

  utter_energy_objectives_guidance:
  - text: "In addition to action plans focused on achieving specific improvements in energy performance, an organization may have action plans that focus on achieving improvements in overall energy management or improvement in the processes of the EnMS itself. Action plans for these types of improvements can also state how the organization will verify the results achieved by the action plan. For example, an organization may have an action plan designed to achieve increased employee and contractor awareness of energy management behaviour. The extent to which the action plan achieves the increased awareness and other results should be verified using the method determined by the organization and documented in the action plan."

  utter_implementation_operation_guidance:
  - text: "The Implementation and Operation section of Annex A provides guidance on how organizations should implement their energy management system and operate it effectively. This includes considerations for competence, training and awareness, communication, documentation, operational control, design, and procurement of energy services, products, equipment and energy."

  utter_competence_training_guidance:
  - text: "The organization defines competence, training and awareness requirements based on its organizational needs. Competency is based on a relevant combination of education, training, skills and experience."

  utter_documentation_guidance:
  - text: "The only procedures that have to be documented are ones that are specified as a documented procedure. The organization can develop any documents that it deems necessary to effectively demonstrate energy performance and support the EnMS."

  utter_operational_control_guidance:
  - text: "An organization should evaluate those of its operations that are associated with its identified significant energy use and ensure that they are conducted in a way that will control or reduce the adverse impacts associated with them, in order to fulfil the requirements of its energy policy and meet its objectives and targets. This should include all parts of its operations, including maintenance activities."

  utter_procurement_guidance:
  - text: "Procurement is an opportunity to improve energy performance through the use of more efficient products and services. It is also an opportunity to work with the supply chain and influence its energy behaviour. The applicability of energy purchasing specifications may vary from market to market. Energy purchasing specification elements could include energy quality, availability, cost structure, environmental impact and renewable sources. The organization may use the specification proposed by an energy supplier, as appropriate."

  utter_internal_audit_guidance:
  - text: "Internal audits of an energy management system can be performed by personnel from within the organization, or by external persons selected by the organization, working on its behalf. In either case, the persons conducting the audit should be competent and in a position to do so impartially and objectively. In smaller organizations, auditor independence can be demonstrated by an auditor being free from responsibility for the activity being audited. If an organization wishes to combine audits of its energy management system with other internal audits, the intent and scope of each should be clearly defined. An energy audit or assessment is not the same concept as an internal audit of an EnMS or an internal audit of the energy performance of an EnMS."

  utter_management_review_guidance:
  - text: "The management review should cover the scope of the energy management system, although not all elements of the energy management system need to be reviewed at once and the review process may take place over a period of time."

  utter_benchmarking:
  - text: "Benchmarking is the process of collecting, analysing and relating energy performance data of comparable activities with the purpose of evaluating and comparing performance between or within entities. Different types of benchmarking exist, ranging from internal benchmarking, for the purpose of highlighting good practices within the organization, to external benchmarking, in order to establish the 'best in industry/sector' performance of an installation/facility or a specific product/service in the same field or sector. The benchmark process can be applied to any or all of these elements. Provided relevant and accurate data are available, benchmarking is a valuable input to an objective energy review, and consequent setting of energy objectives and energy targets."

  utter_energy_audit:
  - text: "An energy audit or assessment comprises a detailed review of the energy performance of an organization, of a process, or both. It is typically based on appropriate measurement and observation of actual energy performance. Audit outputs typically include information on current consumption and performance, and they can be accompanied by a series of ranked recommendations for improvement in terms of energy performance. Energy audits are planned and conducted as part of the identification and prioritization of opportunities to improve energy performance. An energy audit or assessment is not the same concept as an internal audit of an EnMS or an internal audit of the energy performance of an EnMS."
